# Galle Fonts; Reviving typefaces of the Dutch Press in Ceylon

This is the central repository for the Dutch Press in Ceylon project, reviving the typefaces from the Dutch Press in Ceylon (1730â€“1796). A collaborative project managed by Mooniak.


## About
This project started as a side project at Mooniak in 2014 with some help and insight from Dr Sumanthri Samarawickrama. In 2016 Janaka Attanayake initiated an independent version of the Sinhala typeface under the name Svasthi for partial fulfilment of his Comprehensive Design Project for Bachelor of Design degree program at the Department of Integrated Design, University of Moratuwa. Mooniak provided some guidance and help in the production of the font.

In 2017 Mooniak in collaboration with Janaka setup this project to complete the Sinhala typeface and release it under an open license for broader use. In 2018 the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Sri Lanka provided partial funding to expand the project into reviving Tamil typefaces from the Dutch Press and now the project aims to produce a complete set of Sinhala, Tamil and Latin fonts based on the original types from the Dutch Press in Ceylon.
